Runs `fetch_server.sh` to grab a specific server build by number. If I update this, I'll take the latest stable build (announced in the alttpo discord) and use that.

# How to use
There isn't much to the server binary, so just run the container and do something with the exposed udp port. I'm using the default, which is `4590/udp`.

# Building
Put the build ID in the Dockerfile and build. That's about it.
